## Usage

Use `Feedtxt.parse` to read / parse feeds in text using the Feed.TXT
format also known as RSS (Really Simple Sharing) 5.0 ;-).
The parse method will return an array:

```
[ feed_metadata,
  [
    [ item_metadata, item_content ],
    [ item_metadata, item_content ],
    ...
  ]
]
```

- The 1st element is the feed metadata hash.
- The 2nd element is the items array.
  - The 1st element in an item array is the item metadata hash.
  - The 2nd element in an item array is the item content.

Easier to see it in action. Let's read in:

``` ruby
require 'feedtxt'

text =<<TXT
|>>>
title:          "My Example Feed"
home_page_url:  "https://example.org/"
feed_url:       "https://example.org/feed.txt"
</>
id:  "2"
url: "https://example.org/second-item"
---
This is a second item.
</>
id:  "1"
url: "https://example.org/initial-post"
---
Hello, world!
<<<|
TXT

feed = Feedtxt.parse( text )
pp feed
```

resulting in:

``` ruby
[
  {"title"        =>"My Example Feed",
   "home_page_url"=>"https://example.org/",
   "feed_url"     =>"https://example.org/feed.txt"
  },
  [[
     {"id" =>"2",
      "url"=>"https://example.org/second-item"
     },
     "This is a second item."
   ],
   [
     {"id"=>"1",
      "url"=>"https://example.org/initial-post"
     },
     "Hello, world!"
  ]]
]
```

and use like:

``` ruby

feed_metadata = feed[0]
feed_items    = feed[1]

feed_metadata[ 'title' ]
# => "My Example Feed"
feed_metadata[ 'feed_url' ]
# => "https://example.org/feed.txt"

item          = feed_items[0]   # or feed[1][0]
item_metadata = item[0]         # or feed[1][0][0]
item_content  = item[1]         # or feed[1][0][1]

item_metadata[ 'id' ]
# => "2"
item_metadata[ 'url' ]
# => "https://example.org/second-item"
item_content
# => "This is a second item."

item          = feed_items[1]    # or feed[1][1]
item_metadata = item[0]          # or feed[1][1][0]
item_content  = item[1]          # or feed[1][1][1]

item_metadata[ 'id' ]
# => "1"
item_metadata[ 'url' ]
# => "https://example.org/initial-post"
item_content
# => "Hello, world!"
...
```

Another example. Let's try a podcast:


``` ruby
text =<<TXT
|>>>
comment: "This is a podcast feed. You can add..."
title:   "The Record"
home_page_url: "http://therecord.co/"
feed_url:      "http://therecord.co/feed.txt"
</>
id:        "http://therecord.co/chris-parrish"
title:     "Special #1 - Chris Parrish"
url:       "http://therecord.co/chris-parrish"
summary:   "Brent interviews Chris Parrish, co-host of The Record and one-half of Aged & Distilled."
published: 2014-05-09T14:04:00-07:00
attachments:
- url:           "http://therecord.co/downloads/The-Record-sp1e1-ChrisParrish.m4a"
  mime_type:     "audio/x-m4a"
  size_in_bytes: 89970236
  duration_in_seconds: 6629

## Alternative Meta Data Formats

Note: Feed.TXT supports alternative formats / styles for meta data blocks.
For now YAML, JSON and INI style
are built-in and shipping with the `feedtxt` gem.
To use a format-specific parser use:

- `Feedtxt::YAML.parse`
- `Feedtxt::JSON.parse`
- `Feedtxt::INI.parse`

Note: `Feedtxt.parse` will handle all formats auto-magically,
that is, it will check the text for the best matching (first)
feed begin marker
to find out what meta data format parser to use:

| Format | `FEED_BEGIN` |  
|--------|--------------|
| YAML   | `\|>>>`      |
| JSON   | `\|{`        |
| INI    | `[>>>`       |


Or use the built-in text pattern (regular expression)
constants to find out:

``` ruby
Feedtxt::YAML::FEED_BEGIN
# => "^[ ]*\\|>>>+[ ]*$"
Feedtxt::JSON::FEED_BEGIN
# => "^[ ]*\\|{+[ ]*$"
Feedtxt::INI::FEED_BEGIN
# => "^[ ]*\\[>>>+[ ]*$"
```



### JSON Example

```
|{
"title":          "My Example Feed",
"home_page_url":  "https://example.org/",
"feed_url":       "https://example.org/feed.txt"
}/{
"id":  "2",
"url": "https://example.org/second-item"
}-{
This is a second item.
}/{
"id":  "1",
"url": "https://example.org/initial-post"
}-{
Hello, world!
}|
```

Note: Use `|{` and `}|` to begin and end your Feed.TXT.
Use `}/{` for first or next item
and `}-{` for meta blocks inside items.
